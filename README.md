## School District Analysis

### Overview of the School District Analysis

This analysis on school districts will show trends in school performance based on data collected on various schools in the city. The data showcases math and reading scores for students across different grades and school districts, and the analysis will provide key information to the school board for future decision making.
The focus of this analysis will be on Thomas High School, whose math and reading data for its grade nine students show evidence of academic dishonesty. The scores will be omitted in calculating Thomas High School’s performance and the differences will be displayed and discussed. 

### Results of the Analysis

* How is the district summary affected?

  * The overall district summary shows minor changes before and after omitting Thomas High School’s Grade Nine students’ reading and math data. The comparison can be seen [HERE](https://github.com/donovancai/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/district.png).

* How is the school summary affected?

  * By removing Thomas High School’s Grade Nine students’ reading and math data from the total data, the Average Math/Reading Scores, % Passing Math/Reading and % Overall Passing have all increased. Once these data are omitted, math/reading and overall passing grades increased by roughly 26% each. The comparison can be seen [HERE](https://github.com/donovancai/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/school.png).

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

  * Before the omittance of the ninth graders’ math and reading scores, Thomas High School ranked about middle of the pack out of all schools in terms of student performance ([HERE](https://github.com/donovancai/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ranking_before.png)). The data omittance caused Thomas High School to achieve a significantly higher ranking amongst all school, pushing the school up to second overall ([HERE](https://github.com/donovancai/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ranking_after.png)).

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
<br /> 

  * Math and reading scores by grade

  * The only difference by omitting the grade nine data for Thomas High School is there is no data showing for Thomas High School. Since the calculation here is done per grade and the data for Thomas High School is omitted, grade nine performance cannot be compared with other high schools. Performance data for grades ten, eleven and twelve are not changed and can still be compared. For the before and after data see [HERE](https://github.com/donovancai/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/scores_by_grade.png). 

  * Scores by school spending

  * There are no changes in the scores by school spending before and after omitting grade nine math and reading data. 

  * Scores by school size

  * There are no changes in the scores by school size before and after omitting grade nine math and reading data. 

  * Scores by school type

  * There are no changes in the scores by school type before and after omitting grade nine math and reading data. 

### Summary
The four major differences before and after omitting Thomas High School grade nine reading and math data are in % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Overall Passing and the overall district performance. By excluding the grade nine math and reading data, % Passing Math increased by 26.27%, % Passing Reading increased by 27.36%, % Overall Passing increased by 25.55%. The major improvements in these three categories increased the overall district % Passing Math/Reading by 0.2% and the % Overall Passing by 0.3%. This is significant because out of the entire student population of 39,170, there are only 461 grade nine students from Thomas High School, which is about 1.18% of the whole population.
